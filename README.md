## Features

- **P2P NFT Trading**: Trade NFTs directly with other users without the need for a central authority.
- **Secure Transactions**: Utilizes smart contract functionality to ensure secure and trustless transactions.
- **Non-Custodial**: NFTs are held by the contract only during the trade process, ensuring users maintain control of their assets.
